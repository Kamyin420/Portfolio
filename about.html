                <p>In my design journey, I am not bound by conventions. This allows me to focus on ideas without
                    thinking if they are right or wrong. One idea progresses into the next, creating a unique web of
                    ideas, like pieces of a puzzle that were never meant to fit in the first place.</p>

                <p>I am a social person, I really enjoy getting to know people, to interact with them and have a laugh
                    with them. People often describe me as open and I try to treat everyone as I would like to be
                    treated myself. For me, life is all about connecting with each other.</p>

                <p> I enjoy trying new things and failing at them. Every week is different and I love the challenge it
                    brings me.</p>
                <p> In my free time I rarely sit still, I work out a lot, go to museums and watch a lot of movies. I’m
                    always looking to push myself, both physically and mentally.</p>
                <p>Feel free to reach out for a cup of coffee,  I’m always open to a good conversation.</p>
